# SkillChain 🔗 – Verified Skill Stamping on Blockchain

SkillChain is a decentralized Web3-based platform that allows educational institutions and training organizations to issue blockchain-verified certificates. Users (students, professionals) can own, verify, and showcase their skill credentials as NFTs — enabling secure, tamper-proof resumes and smart contract-based hiring.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **User Registration**  
   Users (students, professionals, institutions) register using Web3 wallets.

2. **Certificate Issuance**  
   Institutions issue digital certificates upon course completion and store cryptographic hashes on blockchain.

3. **Verification**  
   Employers verify certificates by entering the certificate ID or scanning a QR/NFT.

4. **NFT Resume**  
   Users can mint certificates as NFTs and build a public decentralized portfolio.

5. **Smart Hiring**  
   Employers post jobs with skill requirements; smart contracts match verified users.
